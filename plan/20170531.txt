Preliminary Steps BEFORE Coding

	    []Establish reliable method of communication
	    []Obtain schedules of each member
	    []Determine when all members are available
	    []Agree on the Components
	    []Figure out how the classes will interact with eachother
	    []Create satisfactory UML diagram
	    []Create a schedule with deadlines for individuals and group work

Components:

	[]Driver.java
	[]Weekly Schedule Planner
	       []Day.java
	       []Event.java
	       []Task.java
	[]Habit Tracker
	      []Habit.java
	      []Tracker.java
	[]History Storage and Access
		[]History.java

Order: Task.java
       Event.java
       Day.java
       Driver.java in accordance with Weekly Schedule Planner
       Debugg and robustify
       
       Habit.java
       Tracker.java
       Driver.java in accordance with HabitTracker
       Debugg and robustify
       
       History.java
       Adapt Weekly Schedule Planner and Habit Tracker
       Driver.java in accordance with History Storage and Access
       Debugg and robustify

       Make sure the display is nice
       Make sure the User Interface is simple and easy to use
       Set loose project and test it out on unsuspecting humans

       Once all tasks above are completed move onto the stretch

Stretch: To be determined
