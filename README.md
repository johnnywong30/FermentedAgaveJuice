### Schedule Planner


  Schedule Planner presents the user a user-friendly interface in the terminal to create and modify their own Schedules. From the terminal the user can: add Events/Tasks/Routines to their schedule, remove Events/Tasks/Routines, or create Schedules for their Friends. Through this program, the user will be able to check when they are free, when their Friends are free, and be notified of an upcoming Event or Task due date. 

### How it Works!


  Schedule Planner operates through our Driver.java file, which has access to Schedules.csv, a file that stores already made Schedules. If the user does not have an active Schedule, they can create one. The user can enter an Event/Task/Routine they'd like to add to a certain time in the command-line, as well as remove them. The user can enter a command to check when they are free, and check when their Friends are free in accordance to their Schedule the user created for them.
